## :boom: Questions and Solution
<a name="digital"></a>
### **A. Digital Analysis**

**Using the available datasets - answer the following questions using a single query for each one:**

  - **Question 1: How many users are there?**

```tsql
select count (distinct user_id) as count_users
from [clique_bait.users];
```
|count_users|
|---|
|500|

  - **Question 2: How many cookies does each user have on average?**

```tsql
with cte_count_cookie as (select user_id,
                                 count (cookie_id) as count_cookie
                          from [clique_bait.users]
                          group by user_id)

select avg (count_cookie) as avg_cookie
from cte_count_cookie;
```
|avg_cookie|
|---|
|3|

  - **Question 3: What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?**

```tsql
select datepart (month, event_time) as [month],
       count (distinct visit_id) as count_visit
from [clique_bait.events]
group by datepart (month, event_time)
order by datepart (month, event_time);
```
|month|count_visit|
|---|---|
|1|876|
|2|1488|
|3|916|
|4|248|
|5|36|

  - **Question 4: What is the number of events for each event type?**

```tsql
select event_type,
       count (event_type) as count_events
from [clique_bait.events]
group by event_type
order by event_type;
```
|event_type|count_events|
|---|---|
|1|20928|
|2|8451|
|3|1777|
|4|876|
|5|702|

  - **Question 5: What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?**

```tsql
select 100 * count (distinct visit_id)/
       (select count (distinct visit_id) from [clique_bait.events]) as percentage_purchase
from [clique_bait.events] e
join [clique_bait.event_identifier] ei on ei.event_type = e.event_type
where event_name = 'purchase'
```
|percentage_purchase|
|---|
|49|

  - **Question 6: What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?**

```tsql
select 100 * count (distinct visit_id)/
       (select count (distinct visit_id) from [clique_bait.events]) as percentage_purchase
from [clique_bait.events] e
join [clique_bait.event_identifier] ei on ei.event_type = e.event_type
join [clique_bait.page_hierarchy] h on h.page_id = e.page_id
where event_name != 'purchase' and page_name = 'checkout';
```
|percentage_purchase|
|---|
|59|

  - **Question 7: What are the top 3 pages by number of views?**

```tsql
select top (3) page_name,
               count (visit_id) as count_of_pageview
from [clique_bait.events] e
join [clique_bait.page_hierarchy] h on h.page_id = e.page_id
join [clique_bait.event_identifier] ei on ei.event_type = e.event_type
where event_name = 'pageview'
group by page_name
order by count (visit_id) desc;
```

|page_name|count_of_pageview|
|---|---|
|AllProducts|3174|
|Checkout|2103|
|HomePage|1782|

  - **Question 8: What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?**

```tsql
select product_category,
       sum (case when event_name = 'Pageview' then 1 else 0 end) as count_pageview,
       sum (case when event_name = 'Addtocart' then 1 else 0 end) as count_addtocart
from [clique_bait.events] e
join [clique_bait.page_hierarchy] h on h.page_id = e.page_id
join [clique_bait.event_identifier] ei on ei.event_type = e.event_type
group by product_category
order by product_category;
```

                      join [clique_bait.page_hierarchy] h on h.page_id = e.page_id
                      join [clique_bait.event_identifier] ei on ei.event_type = e.event_type
                      where visit_id in (select visit_id

                                          where event_type = 3)) -- purchase

select top (3) page_name,
               count (cte.page_id) as count_product
from cte_purchase cte
join [clique_bait.page_hierarchy] h on h.page_id = cte.page_id

### **B. Product Funnel Analysis**

 - **Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:**
   - **How many times was each product viewed?**
   - **How many times was each product added to cart?**
   - **How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?**
   - **How many times was each product purchased?**

***Query*** 
```tsql

                                   sum (case when event_type = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as views,
                                   sum (case when event_type = 2 then 1 else 0 end) as addtocard
                            from [clique_bait.events] e
                            join [clique_bait.page_hierarchy] h on h.page_id = e.page_id
                            group by page_name, product_category),

     cte_count_abandoned as (select page_name, product_category,

                            from [clique_bait.events] e
                            join [clique_bait.page_hierarchy] h on e.page_id = h.page_id

 - **Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:**
   - **Question 1:Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?**
  
```tsql
with cte_rank as (select product_name,
                         row_number () over (order by views desc) as rank_views,

                         row_number () over (order by purchase desc) as rank_purchase

   - **Question 2:Which product was most likely to be abandoned?**

```tsql

### **C. Campaigns Analysis**

 - **Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:**
   - **user_id**
   - **visit_id**
   - **visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit**
   - **page_views: count of page views for each visit**
   - **cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit**
   - **purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit**
   - **campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date**
   - **impression: count of ad impressions for each visit**
   - **click: count of ad clicks for each visit**
   - **(Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)**

***The result has 3052 rows***



 - **Use the subsequent dataset to generate at least 5 insights for the Clique Bait team - bonus: prepare a single A4 infographic that the team can use for their management reporting sessions, be sure to emphasise the most important points from your findings.**

 - **Some ideas you might want to investigate further include:**

   - **Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event**
   - **Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?**
   - **What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?**
   - **What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?**
